# Name of your quickstart as shown on the website
name: SAML Metadata Certificate Validation
description: >
  A script to validate the X509 Certificate data in SAML metadata and confirm that it is not expiring soon.
  The SAML Metadata structure allows some variance in field names and namespaces, so this script strips namespaces and attempts to find a list of entities in either location.
  SAML Metadata requirements are documented here: https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/56785/sstc-saml-metadata-errata-2.0-wd-05.pdf
  This script uses parts of the Cert Check script found here: https://forum.newrelic.com/s/hubtopic/aAX8W0000008ZtLWAU/relic-solution-monitoring-ssl-certificate-expiration
  Requires a target URL.

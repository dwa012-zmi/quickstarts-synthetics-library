# Name of your quickstart as shown on the website
name: Check s3 Object
description: >
  Boilerplate script that checks the size of an Object in s3 against a given value.
  This can be expanded to verify any metadata of an s3 object and with a little work the file structure of the object etc.
  Veryuseful in ETL pipelines.
